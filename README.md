## ðŸ”§ Advanced Setup

### Configure Perspective Transformation
To ensure accurate real-world measurements:
1. Define four points on the playing field in the video frame.
2. Map these points to their real-world coordinates in meters.
3. Use OpenCV's `cv2.getPerspectiveTransform` and `cv2.warpPerspective` functions to apply the transformation.
